# SDLC SimLab

**Agent-Based Modeling Platform for Software Development Team Dynamics**

SDLC SimLab is an agent-based model (ABM) that simulates software development teams to forecast organizational change outcomes. It models developers as autonomous agents with configurable communication patterns and success rates, enabling data-driven insights into throughput, quality, and business impacts.

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Engineering leaders face critical challenges when making team and project decisions:

- **Scaling Uncertainty**: Will adding 5 developers actually speed up delivery, or slow us down?
- **Change Impact Blind Spots**: What happens if we cut scope by 30%? Accelerate the timeline?
- **Resource Allocation**: How do we balance team size, timeline, and quality?
- **Risk Assessment**: What are the risks of this reorganization?

SDLC SimLab provides a simulation environment to explore these questions before making costly organizational changes.

## Key Features (Planned)

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)
- ✅ Project initialization and architecture
- ✅ Core simulation engine with basic agent model
- ✅ Single scenario simulation (basic_simulation.py example)
- ✅ YAML/JSON scenario configuration system
- ✅ CSV data import for historical metrics
- ✅ Technical debt and incident tracking

### Phase 2: Enhancements (Months 4-6)
- ⏳ GitHub/GitLab integration for automatic data import
- ⏳ Scenario comparison mode
- ⏳ Enhanced visualizations (D3.js/Plotly)
- ⏳ Model calibration tools
- ⏳ Alpha release

### Phase 3: Optimization (Months 7-9)
- ⏳ Multi-objective optimization engine
- ⏳ Advanced analytics and insights
- ⏳ Report generation (PDF, PowerPoint)
- ⏳ Beta release

### Phase 4: Scale & Polish (Months 10-12)
- ⏳ Performance optimization
- ⏳ Additional integrations (Jira, Linear, Slack)
- ⏳ Enterprise features (SSO, RBAC)
- ⏳ V1.0 release

## Tech Stack

- **Simulation Engine**: Python, Mesa (or custom ABM)
- **API**: FastAPI, Celery + Redis
- **Frontend**: React, D3.js/Plotly
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, InfluxDB/TimescaleDB
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, GCP

## Metrics Tracked

### Primary DX Metrics
- Diffs per Engineer
- Developer Experience Index
- Change failure rate
- Percentage of time spent on new capabilities

### Secondary Metrics
- Lead time, deployment frequency, perceived rate of delivery
- Time to 10th PR, ease of delivery
- Regrettable attrition, failed deployment recovery time
- Perceived software quality
- Operational health and security metrics
- Initiative progress and ROI
- Revenue per engineer, R&D as percentage of revenue

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd sdlc_abm

# Set up Python environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Run tests (when implemented)
pytest tests/
```

## Learning Goals

This is a learning project with the following objectives:

- 🎓 Learn React development and modern frontend practices
- 🎓 Explore systems design and architecture at scale
- 🎓 Understand agent-based modeling techniques
- 🎓 Gain hands-on experience with Docker and Kubernetes
- 🎓 Practice AI-assisted development with Claude Code

Some aspects may be intentionally over-engineered for educational purposes.

## Development Philosophy

- **Learning-First**: Balance practical delivery with learning objectives
- **AI-Assisted**: Built primarily with Claude Code
- **Well-Documented**: Code clarity and documentation prioritized
- **Test-Driven**: Comprehensive testing strategy
- **Iterative**: Ship early, iterate based on feedback

## Core Simulation Concepts

### Agent Model

Each developer agent has configurable attributes:
- Experience Level (Junior → Principal)
- Productivity Rate (PRs per week)
- Code Quality (success rate)
- Review Capacity
- Onboarding Time
- Communication Bandwidth
- Specializations

### Communication Model

Simulates information loss in team communication:
- **Communication Loss Factor**: 0 (perfect) to 1 (total loss)
- **Overhead Scaling**: Linear, Quadratic (default), or Hierarchical
- **Sync vs Async**: Configurable ratio affecting latency

### Simulation Loop

Daily timestep simulation:
1. Agents create PRs based on productivity
2. Agents review PRs based on capacity
3. Communication occurs (with configurable loss)
4. Meetings consume time
5. Incidents occur probabilistically
6. Metrics calculated and recorded
